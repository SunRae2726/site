            <hr/>
            <p>All around the world, cats are being abused and abandoned. Many are sent to shelters, but that doesn't always end the ordeal.
              Shelters may have more resorces compared to a single household, but they also have to care for a lot more cats.
              Many people think lightly of sending their cats to shelters if they suddenly don't want them anymore.
              But, it's thoughts like these that cause shelter overflows, leading to worse and worse conditions for these poor kitties.
              <i>Care For Cats</i> is a non-profit charity that raises money for these struggling cats. </p>

            <hr/>
            <p>The beginning of the pandemic, quarentine led to a longing for company, creating a demand for more pets. This was good news
                for struggling shelters as cats and other animals were able to find a new home. However, as the people start getting tired
                of the living secluded and start going out, pets are left at home alone. People go back to working in-person, eating in-person,
                and don't want to bother with taking care of a pet anymore. Cats are one animal affected by this sudden surge of people abandoning
                animals in shelters. This is not always a bad choice. However, due to this specifc situation, <mark>shelters are severely overflowing.</mark>
                Shelters can't cope with so many animals and are forced to move their hand. <strong> Protect these cats today by adoption or donation.</strong> </p>

                    <strong>Adoption and Donation.</strong> Adoption is the sure fire way to help a struggling kitty. This not only allows you to directly provide for a cat, but also
                     relieves the pressure on the shelter, even if it's only a bit. Donation is another option. Many people are unable to care for a cat, this could be due to a lack of time,
                     an allery, or maybe it's too much pressure. Either way, donations can help shelters provide for the cats.

                    <strong>When you cannot care for the cat any longer.</strong> Avoid sending your cat to shelter if you don't need to. Going on a holiday?
                    Hire a someone to take care of your cat. Don't feel like having a cat anymore? Try giving the cat away to someone you know.
                    If none of these options are avliable, and you don't have the ability to take care of the cat for any longer (such as struggling with money), send them to a shelter.

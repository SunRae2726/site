        <h4> Trash of the Count's Family </h4><br/>

                <p>When I opened my eyes, I was inside a novel. <br/><br/>

                [The Birth of a Hero].<br/><br/>
                [The Birth of a Hero] was a novel focused on the adventures of the main character, Choi Han, a high school boy who was transported to a different dimension from Earth, along with the birth of the numerous heroes of the continent.
                <br/><br/>
                I became a part of that novel as the trash of the Count’s family, the family that oversaw the territory where the first village that Choi Han visits is located.
                <br/><br/>
                The problem is that Choi Han becomes twisted after that village, and everyone in it, are destroyed by assassins.
                <br/><br/>
                The bigger problem is the fact that this trash who I’ve become doesn’t know about what happened in the village and messes with Choi Han, only to get beaten to a pulp.
                <br/><br/>
                “…This is going to be a problem.”
                <br/><br/>
                I feel like something serious has happened to me.
                <br/><br/>
                But it was worth trying to make this my new life.</p></div><br/>

                      <p>Jinhyuk, a gaming Nutuber, was the only person who saw the ending of the game [Tower of Trials].
                        <br/><br/>
                        However, when the game’s popularity declined, it became difficult for him to continue making a living as a gaming Nutuber.
                        <br/>
                        Since he already saw the ending of the game, he was about to quit playing. But that day, [Tower of Trials] became reality, and Jinhyuk, who knew about every single thing in the game, took over everything faster than anyone possibly could!
